# Spaceflight Terminal - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Gaia Terminal has been completely refactored into Spaceflight Terminal, a modern web-based terminal with a spaceship-prompt inspired interface. The refactoring has transformed both the UI and the underlying architecture, resulting in a more maintainable, feature-rich application.

## Key Changes

### 1. UI Overhaul
- **Spaceship-Style Prompt**: Implemented a multi-line prompt inspired by the spaceship-prompt project
- **Modern Design**: Refined the color scheme, typography, and overall visual aesthetic
- **Dynamic UI Elements**: Added animations, improved modals, and enhanced navigational components
- **Better Typography**: Integrated JetBrains Mono as the primary font for improved readability

### 2. Architecture Improvements
- **State Management**: Migrated to Zustand for simpler, more maintainable state management
- **Component Structure**: Organized components into logical groupings with clear responsibilities
- **CSS Improvements**: Enhanced styled-components implementation with better organization
- **Terminal Engine**: Optimized xterm.js integration with proper handling of ANSI escape sequences

### 3. Features Added
- **Advanced Prompt**: Multi-line prompt with contextual information (git status, execution time, etc.)
- **Settings Panel**: Added user-configurable settings for terminal appearance and behavior
- **Improved SSH Integration**: Enhanced SSH modal with recent connections and better UX
- **Command Simulation**: Expanded the simulated command set (git, node, npm)

### 4. Documentation
- **User Guide**: Created comprehensive user documentation
- **Implementation Guide**: Detailed technical documentation for developers
- **Prompt Guide**: Specialized guide for the spaceship-prompt implementation
- **Design Document**: Overview of design principles and architecture

## Testing Notes

The Spaceflight Terminal has been manually tested with the following scenarios:
- Local command execution and simulation
- SSH connections to remote servers
- Terminal settings configuration
- Multiple terminal tab management
- Command history navigation
- Prompt section visibility based on context

## Future Work

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Terminal split views (horizontal/vertical)
- Persistent sessions across page reloads  
- File browser integration
- More extensive command simulation
- Custom theme support
- Plugin system for terminal extensions
